<b><i><font color='red'><h2><u>DBMS TUTORIAL</u></h2></font></i></b><br>

<b>DBMS Tutorial</b><br>

DBMS Tutorial provides basic and advanced concepts of Database. Our DBMS Tutorial is designed for beginners and professionals both.<br>

Database management system is software that is used to manage the database.
<br>
Our DBMS Tutorial includes all topics of DBMS such as introduction, ER model, keys, relational model, join operation, SQL, functional dependency, transaction, concurrency control, etc.<br>

<b><i><font color='red'><h2><u>What is Database</u></h2></font></i></b><br>
The database is a collection of inter-related data which is used to retrieve, insert and delete the data efficiently. It is also used to organize the data in the form of a table, schema, views, and reports, etc.
<br>
<b>For example: </b><br>The college Database organizes the data about the admin, staff, students and faculty etc.

Using the database, you can easily retrieve, insert, and delete the information.<br>


<h2>Database Management System</h2><br>
Database management system is a software which is used to manage the database. For example: MySQL, Oracle, etc are a very popular commercial database which is used in different applications.<br>
DBMS provides an interface to perform various operations like database creation, storing data in it, updating data, creating a table in the database and a lot more.<br>
It provides protection and security to the database. In the case of multiple users, it also maintains data consistency.<br>
<b>DBMS allows users the following tasks:</b><br>

Data Definition: It is used for creation, modification, and removal of definition that defines the organization of data in the database.<br>
<b>Data Updation:</b> It is used for the insertion, modification, and deletion of the actual data in the database.<br>
<b>Data Retrieval:</b> It is used to retrieve the data from the database which can be used by applications for various purposes.<br>
User Administration: It is used for registering and monitoring users, maintain data integrity, enforcing data security, dealing with concurrency control, <br>monitoring performance and recovering information corrupted by unexpected failure.<br><br>
<b>Characteristics of DBMS</b><br>
It uses a digital repository established on a server to store and manage the information.<br>
It can provide a clear and logical view of the process that manipulates data.<br>
DBMS contains automatic backup and recovery procedures.<br>
It contains ACID properties which maintain data in a healthy state in case of failure.<br>
It can reduce the complex relationship between data.<br>
It is used to support manipulation and processing of data.<br>
It is used to provide security of data.<br>
It can view the database from different viewpoints according to the requirements of the user.<br>
<h2>Advantages of DBMS</h2><br>
Controls database redundancy: It can control data redundancy because it stores all the data in one single database file and that recorded data is placed in the database.<br>
Data sharing: In DBMS, the authorized users of an organization can share the data among multiple users.<br>
Easily Maintenance: It can be easily maintainable due to the centralized nature of the database system.<br>
Reduce time: It reduces development time and maintenance need.<br>
Backup: It provides backup and recovery subsystems which create automatic backup of data from hardware and software failures and restores the data if required.
multiple user interface: It provides different types of user interfaces like graphical user interfaces, application program interfaces<br>
<h2>Disadvantages of DBMS</h2><br>
Cost of Hardware and Software: It requires a high speed of data processor and large memory size to run DBMS software.<br>
Size: It occupies a large space of disks and large memory to run them efficiently.<br>
Complexity: Database system creates additional complexity and requirements.<br>
Higher impact of failure: Failure is highly impacted the database because in most of the organization, all the data stored in a single database and if the database is damaged due to electric failure or database corruption then the data may be lost forever.<br>
