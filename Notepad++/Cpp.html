<b><i><font color='red'><h2><u>C++</u></h2></font></i></b><br>
<p>C++ is a middle-level programming language developed by Bjarne Stroustrup starting in 1979 at Bell Labs. C++ runs on a variety of platforms, such as Windows, Mac OS, and the various versions of UNIX. This C++ tutorial adopts a simple and practical approach to describe the concepts of C++ for beginners to advanded software engineers.</p><br>

<b>Why to Learn C++</b><br>
<p>C++ is a MUST for students and working professionals to become a great Software Engineer. I will list down some of the key advantages of learning C++:</p><br>

C++ is very close to hardware, so you get a chance to work at a low level which gives you lot of control in terms of memory management, better performance and finally a robust software development.<br>

C++ programming gives you a clear understanding about Object Oriented Programming. You will understand low level implementation of polymorphism when you will implement virtual tables and virtual table pointers, or dynamic type identification.<br>

C++ is one of the every green programming languages and loved by millions of software developers. If you are a great C++ programmer then you will never sit without work and more importantly you will get highly paid for your work.<br>

<p>C++ is the most widely used programming languages in application and system programming. So you can choose your area of interest of software development.</p><br>

C++ really teaches you the difference between compiler, linker and loader, different data types, storage classes, variable types their scopes etc.<br>

<p>There are 1000s of good reasons to learn C++ Programming. But one thing for sure, to learn any programming language, not only C++, you just need to code, and code and finally code until you become expert.</p><br>

<b>Hello World using C++</b><br><br>
<p>Just to give you a little excitement about C++ programming, I'm going to give you a small conventional C++ Hello World program, You can try it using Demo link</p><br>

C++ is a super set of C programming with additional implementation of object-oriented concepts.<br><br>

Live Demo<br>
#include<iostream> <br>
using namespace std<br>

// main() is where program execution begins.<br>
int main() {<br>
   cout << "Hello World"; // prints Hello World
   return 0;
}<br>
<b>There are many C++ compilers available which you can use to compile and run above mentioned program:</b><br>

Apple C++. Xcode<br>

Bloodshed Dev-C++<br>

Clang C++<br>

Cygwin (GNU C++)  <br>

Mentor Graphics  <br>

MINGW - "Minimalist GNU for Windows  <br>

GNU CC source    <br>

IBM C++   <br>

Intel C++  <br>

Microsoft Visual C++ <br>

Oracle C++  <br>

HP C++  <br>

It is really impossible to give a complete list of all the available compilers. The C++ world is just too large and too much new is happening.   <br>
